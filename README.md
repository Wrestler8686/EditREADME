What I learned from LeetCode Problems
Two Sum LeetCode:
1. How to make a vector.
2. How to push_back(i) into a vector.
Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums
1. long long variable for large outputs
2. Using a double for loop for all possible combonatrics
3. Using a sort(result, result +12);
4. You can use const int mod = 1e9+7; to filter out large solutions. You can then mod this by the answer. This conforms to the problem reauirement of having a solution within modulao 1e9+7.
